HOW TO RUN YOUR OWN GIT SERVER
-------------------------------------------------------

apt install -y git-core

useradd git
passwd git

ssh-keygen -t rsa
It will ask you to provide the location for storing the key, just hit Enter to use the default location.

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh git@remote-server "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"

Now ssh into the server and create a project directory for Git. You can use the desired path for the repo.
git@server:~ $ mkdir -p /home/swapnil/project-1.git
git@server:~ $ mkdir -p /home/swapnil/project-1.git

Then create an empty repo:
git init --bare
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/swapnil/project-1.git


We now need to create a Git repo on the local machine.
mkdir -p /home/swapnil/git/project
cd /home/swapnil/git/project

Now create the files that you need for the project in this directory. Stay in this directory and initiate git:
git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/swapnil/git/project

Now add files to the repo:
git add .
Now every time you add a file or make changes you have to run the add command above. You also need to write a commit message with every change in a file. The commit message basically tells what changes were made.
git commit -m "message" -a

If you made changes to only one you can specify the name of that file instead of using '-a'.
git commit -m "message" GoT.txt

Now we have to push these changes to the server so the work is accessible over the Internet and you can collaborate with other team members.
git remote add origin ssh://git@remote-server/repo-<wbr< a="">>path-on-server..git

Now you can push or pull changes between the server and local machine using the 'push' or 'pull' option:
git push origin master

If there are other team members who want to work with the project they need to clone the repo on the server to their local machine:
git clone git@remote-server:/home/swapnil/project.git

Here /home/swapnil/project.git is the project path on the remote server, exchange the values for your own server.
Then change directory on the local machine (exchange project with the name of project on your server):

cd /project
Now they can edit files, write commit change messages and then push them to the server:

git commit -m 'corrections in GoT.txt story' -a
And then push changes:
git push origin master

On laptop: mount /dev/sda4 /stor1
and from remote:
git clone user2@192.168.11.196:/stor1/git
